                  This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is part of and
                  incorporated into the Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”)
                  governing your use and access of willowmanorcare.com. By
                  using willowmanorcare.com, or any part thereof, you consent
                  to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information,
                  as described in this Privacy Policy. ​ What type of
                  information do we collect? Elder Care Solutions does not
                  request any personal information, such as your name, email
                  address or other contact information, in order for you to
                  use willowmanorcare.com (“Personal Information”). The Site
                  does use various technologies to improve your online
                  experience, and such technologies may collect information
                  about your use of willowmanorcare.com. The collection and
                  use of such information is described in this Privacy Policy.
                  Any information you do enter is received, collected and
                  stored. This includes email address, purchase history, name,
                  payment details (including credit card information),
                  comments, and feedback. We may use software tools to measure
                  and collect session information, including page response
                  times, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction
                  information, and methods used to browse away from the page.
                  Usage Information is not considered Personal Information for
                  the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Elder Care Solutions
                  may make available social media widgets and plugins so that
                  you can use social networking to share items from the Site
                  with certain social media platforms. If these interactive
                  mini-programs are made available to you on the Site, you
                  understand that they run on the Site and collect your IP
                  address, which page you are visiting on willowmanorcare.com,
                  and set a cookie to enable the widget to function properly.
                  Your interactions with these widgets are governed by the
                  terms and privacy policy of the company providing them, and
                  not by the Agreement or this Privacy Policy. Use and
                  Disclosure of Usage Information Elder Care Solutions may use
                  and disclose the Usage Information to provide, operate, and
                  improve the Site, Content, and/or Elder Care Solutions’
                  products and services, to provide our Users with ongoing
                  customer assistance and technical support; and to contact
                  our Visitors and Users with general or personalized
                  service-related notices. ​ In addition, Elder Care Solutions
                  may also use the Usage Information for its own internal
                  business purposes including statistical, design or
                  operational purposes, such as to estimate audience size,
                  measure aggregate traffic patterns and understand
                  demographic trends among users. ​ Elder Care Solutions may
                  also share, disclose or transfer Usage Information in
                  connection with a merger, sale of all or some of its assets,
                  debt financing, or other corporate event, including for
                  transaction due diligence (collectively, a “Corporate
                  Change”). In the event of a Corporate Change (either during
                  due diligence or upon the consummation of the Corporate
                  Change), Elder Care Solutions may transfer the Usage
                  Information, in whole or in part, to the relevant third
                  part(ies) and, if such Corporate Change actually occurs,
                  such Usage Information will then be subject to the privacy
                  policies of such third part(ies). ​ Elder Care Solutions may
                  also use and disclose the Usage Information as required by
                  law, when Elder Care Solutions believes it is appropriate to
                  comply with law enforcement requests, and/or to enforce this
                  Privacy Policy or the Agreement, or otherwise to protect
                  Elder Care Solutions’ and Elder Care Solutions’ users’
                  rights, property or safety. ​ Use and Disclosure of
                  Aggregated Information Elder Care Solutions may create
                  aggregated, anonymized information that may include or be
                  based upon Usage Information, along with the similar
                  information of other users (“Aggregated Information”). You
                  are not identifiable in Aggregated Information. Aggregated
                  Information is not considered Usage Information for the
                  purposes of this Privacy Policy. Elder Care Solutions may
                  use, disclose, share and/or sell Aggregated Information for
                  any purpose, including providing it to third parties for
                  their own business or marketing purposes. ​ Storage of

                  California residents only – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
                  Companies that collect personally identifiable information
                  from California residents and disclose such information to
                  third parties for marketing purposes must, in response to a
                  request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing
                  the categories of information shared and the entities to
                  which such information was provided, or (2) provide a
                  mechanism by which a consumer may opt-out of having their
                  information shared with third parties. We have elected the
                  second option and you may request that your personally
                  identifiable information not be shared with third parties by
                  sending your request, including your full name, email
                  address and postal address to: Elder Care Solutions, LLC.
                  Attn: General Counsel, 607 Walnut Ave SE, Roanoke, Virginia,
                  24014. In accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1789.3,
                  California resident users are entitled to know that they may
                  file grievances and complaints with California Department of
                  Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA

                  email to dca@dca.ca.gov. Do Not Track Disclosures No action
                  is taken in response to web browser “do not track” signals
                  or other mechanisms that provide users the ability to
                  exercise choice regarding the collection of personally
                  identifiable information about an individual’s online
                  activities over time and across third-party web sites or
                  online services. Although Elder Care Solutions uses Google
                  Analytics and other third party tracking tools for the Site,
                  we are not aware if third parties collect personally
                  identifiable information about an individual’s online
                  activities when such an individual uses the Site. ​
