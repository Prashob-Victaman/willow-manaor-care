                    Services 2.1: Elder Services is a platform for connecting
                    persons who are looking to engage self-employed independent
                    care professionals (ICPs) to provide in-home care (each a
                    “Placement”), and ICPs who are part of Elder’s network ICPs
                    who may be available to perform such Placement. Elder checks
                    the backgrounds of each ICP via third party background check
                    Services; however, Elder does not guarantee or warrant, and
                    makes no representations regarding, the reliability, quality
                    or suitability of such ICPs. It is the sole responsibility
                    of each ICP, and not Elder, to determine whether they are
                    qualified and capable of completing a particular Placement.
                    It is the sole responsibility of each Customer to ensure
                    that they are satisfied with the suitability, qualifications
                    and capability of each ICP for each Placement, including
                    checking any ICP’s Right to Work documentation which will be
                    made available to You on request by Elder. When You book a
                    Placement or deal with an ICP, You should ensure that You
                    agree to use common sense and caution to ensure protection
                    of personal property and safety, including by supervising
                    ICPs as You would supervise anyone who provided a Services
                    to You that You did not know. During any Placement, the ICP
                    works directly for You. LIVE-IN CARE 2.2: Live-in ICPs have
                    various rights pursuant to the law, and You hereby agree to
                    provide each ICP : 2.2.1: a minimum break of 2 hours per day
                    within daylight hours. At the request of the ICP, it is
                    permissible for these breaks to be banked to provide a
                    longer individual break but the minimum duration is 14 hours
                    over 7 days; and 2.2.2: sanitary living conditions must
                    include (i) a separate bedroom and suitable bathing and
                    toilet facilities; (ii) clean bedding and (iii) provision of
                    ample food. In respect of (iii), we recommend a minimum sum
                    of £40 per week for the cost of the ICP’s food. LIVE-OUT
                    CARE 2.3 Live-out ICPs: You and each Live-out ICP will be
                    responsible for agreeing hours and duties directly on any
                    placement, and Live-out ICPs may not be entitled to any
                    breaks or other accommodation within the Placement. 3. Fees
                    3.1 When You make a Placement booking, Elder will help
                    facilitate the Placement by providing an account mechanism
                    for paying ICP Placement fees (“Fees”). Fees are
                    non-refundable (unless You provide Elder with a minimum of
                    48 hours’ notice before the Placement is due to start) and
                    will be charged to You in accordance with Elder’s pricing
                    schedule, which Elder may update from time to time. You may
                    also be informed by Elder of any changes made to the amount
                    or basis of any payments due by You from time to time. You
                    are liable for any and all taxes (other than taxes based on
                    Elder’s income) related to the Placement performed by ICPs,
                    apart from ICP’s own income tax accountability which is met
                    directly by each ICP. 3.2 Elder will charge You for
                    Placements through the payment method specified in Your
                    account (e.g. a credit card or debit card). If You pay any
                    applicable Fees with a credit card, Elder may seek
                    pre-authorisation of Your credit card account prior to the
                    Placement starting to verify that the credit card is valid
                    and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover
                    Your requested Placement. 3.3 You agree to Elder authorising
                    any designated credit card, or debit card or other payment
                    method or account to pay any Fees described herein, and
                    authorise Elder to charge all sums due at any time to that
                    designated account. You agree to provide Elder as soon as
                    possible with updated information regarding Your designated
                    credit card and account or upon Elder’s request and any time
                    the information earlier provided is no longer valid. 3.4 You
                    are responsible for ensuring all billing and contact details
                    are up to date to ensure invoices sent by Elder are
                    accurate, and payments received by Elder are on time, with
                    no delay. 3.5 Elder reserves the right to charge You an

                    period of 6 months after Elder has introduced an ICP to You,
                    You decide to engage that ICP directly, Elder reserves the
                    right to charge You a fee reflecting (but not exceeding) the
                    total payment of 6 months of care provided by the ICP

                    receiving emails, SMS and other messages. Please note that
                    by doing so, this may have an effect on the Services You

                    can be undertaken. 5.4 You agree to update the Care
                    Appraisal on a regular basis, dependent on Your care needs,

                    to time request that You update the Care Appraisal to
                    reflect the Care Recipient’s needs. 5.5 You agree to Elder
                    using any Feedback You provide for reports, marketing or
                    advertising purposes, which Feedback shall only be used in

                    and Modification of the Services TERMINATION BY ELDER 10.1
                    If You violate any of the Agreement Terms, Your permission
                    to use the Services will automatically terminate with
                    immediate effect. 10.2 You also agree that Elder may, at any
                    time and without notice to You, suspend or revoke Your
                    access to and use of the Services, and any account(s) You
                    may have in connection with the Services: (i) for any reason
                    or no reason at all; (ii) where Elder determines at our sole
                    discretion that such action is reasonable in order to comply
                    with legal requirements or to protect the rights or
                    interests of the Elder or any third party; or (iii) in

                    We also reserve the right to modify the Services at any time
                    without notice to You. 10.3 Please note, that whilst the
                    matter remains at Elder’s sole discretion, Elder is likely
                    to terminate this Agreement, and reserves its rights to do
                    so, if You fail or delay to make payments of 4 invoices in
                    succession; fail or delay to make payment for a period of 4
                    weeks or more; or over a period of 6 months prior to
                    termination, the account held by You has fallen into arrears
                    on more than 2 occasions. 10.4 Notification will be made by
                    Notice by Elder to You at the email address provided by You
                    and/or by letter by Royal Mail 10.5 Elder will have no
                    liability whatsoever as a result of any change to the
                    Services or any suspension or revocation of Your access to
                    or use of the Services. TERMINATION BY YOU 10.6 You may
                    terminate this Agreement, and Your account with Elder, at
                    any time by contacting customer Services at hello@elder.org,
                    providing Elder with a minimum of 14 days’ notice of Your
                    intention to do so. Any termination made by You without
                    providing the minimum notice, may incur a financial penalty
                    over any costs incurred by ICP in the Placement, and You
                    will be liable for all sums due up to and including the date
                    of termination. 10.7 If You choose to cancel the Services,
                    You are still liable to Elder for payment of all Services
                    undertaken or due to be undertaken by Elder or the ICP on
                    Your behalf. 10.8 Elder reserves the right to charge You (at
                    its sole discretion) in full for all and any part of the
                    Services undertaken on Your behalf for the whole of the
                    Notice Period. Such Notice Period charges will be added to
                    Your final invoice, and will be due and payable by You in
                    full within 7 days after the last day of the Notice period,
                    or within 14 days of the last day of the provision of the
                    Services, whichever is sooner. 10.9 If You choose to engage
                    any ICP directly (in contravention of the Terms of this
                    Agreement) You become immediately liable to Elder for the
                    Fees equal to six (6) months’ Fees for the ICP’s Placement
                    with You or any other Customer or Care Recipient. 11.
                    Indemnity You agree that You will be personally responsible
                    for Your use of the Services, and You agree to defend,
                    indemnify and hold harmless Elder and its officers,
                    directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries
                    and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
                    damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
                    solicitors’ and accounting fees and costs, arising out of
                    the use of the Services by You, the Care Recipient, or
                    anyone on Your or their behalf. We reserve the right, at our
                    own expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of
                    any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You, and
                    in such case, You agree to cooperate with our defence of
                    such claim. You will not, in any event, settle any claim,
                    prospective, litigated, or other related matter without our
                    written consent. 12. Use of the Services Is Entirely At Your
                    Risk 12.1 You expressly understand and agree that Your use
                    of the Services is at Your sole risk and that the Services
                    is provided “as is” and “as available”. Elder expressly
                    excludes all warranties and conditions, (whether implied by
                    statute, common law or otherwise and including any warranty
                    as to fitness for purpose and satisfactory quality, and
                    non-infringement) to the maximum extent permitted by law.
                    12.2 When You use the Services to request and have an ICP
                    perform a Placement, You understand and acknowledge that no
                    ICP has any authority to make any amendments to this
                    Agreement and that any statements, representations, or
                    warranties made by an ICP or any third party are disclaimed
                    by Elder and do not expand or otherwise modify this
                    Agreement. Elder makes no representation or warranty
                    regarding the identity, quality, reliability, safety,
                    completeness, or fitness of ICP. 12.3 Once any Placement
                    starts, the ICP engaged in that Placement works directly
                    for, and under the direction of, You. 13. Limitation of
                    Liability and Release 13.1 To the extent permitted by
                    applicable law, Elder will not be liable to You in
                    connection with Elder’s performance under this Agreement,
                    including (but not limited to) liability for loss of profits
                    and other consequential losses. 13.2 Elder’s liability to
                    You in respect of the Services or any Placement will not
                    exceed the total price paid by You for the Placement,
                    whether such cause of action is brought in contract, tort,
                    warranty or otherwise. 13.3 Except in the case of death or
                    personal injury caused by Elder’s negligence, Elder’s
                    liability under or in connection with this Agreement whether
                    arising in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory
                    duty or otherwise howsoever shall not exceed the level of
                    any Fees paid by You to the Company in the last six months
                    under these Terms and Conditions. 13.4 Neither Party shall
                    be liable to the other Party in contract, tort, negligence,
                    breach of statutory duty nor otherwise for any loss, damage,
                    costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever incurred or
                    suffered by that other Party of an indirect or consequential
                    nature including without limitation any economic loss or
                    other loss of turnover, profits, business or goodwill. 13.5
                    The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental
                    elements of the basis of the bargain between Elder and You.
                    13.6 Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any rights You
                    might have as a consumer or other statutory rights that may
                    not be excluded by law, nor exclude or limit our liability
                    to You for any death or personal injury resulting from our
                    negligence. General 14.1 This Agreement, together with the
                    Privacy Policy constitutes the entire and exclusive
                    understanding and agreement between You and Elder regarding
                    Your use of and access to the Services, and except as
                    expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written
                    agreement signed by or on behalf of each Party. 14.2 You may
                    not assign or transfer the Agreement or Your rights
                    hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
